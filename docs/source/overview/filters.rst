Filters
======================

Image Marker includes some basic image manipulation.

- In **Filter > Stretch**, the user can set the brightness scaling, the two options being **Linear** (default) and **Log**.
- In **Filter > Interval**, the user can set the interval of brightness values which are displayed. The two options are **Min-Max** (default) and **ZScale**. Computation of the stretch and interval is done with ``astropy``.
- In **Filter > Gaussian Blur**, the user can blur the image using a slider. The blurring computations are done using ``astropy`` and ``scipy``.
